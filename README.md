Colonization really does affect the people living there. It psuehs beacuse their culture and beliefs and the new ones take over. They are left in the background while all the new is thriving. It is unfair to the original people there because they were there first and should get some choice but instead they are taken over. The people there already get tortured and punished. It is unfair.
